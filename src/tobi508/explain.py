"""Explanations of TT tests and their results, in plain language.

One building block, reused: the `explain` prompt uses it now, and failure
reports with recommended fixes will use it later. It assembles the material
an agent needs to explain from the source rather than from memory: the TT
test text and WCAG links (catalog), what this tool does for the test (each
check's `about`), and, after a run, the findings.

Two modes:
  before a run  what a test checks, who it helps, how a Trusted Tester tests
                it, what this tool can and cannot do for it, how to run it.
  after a run   what was found, what it means, how to fix it, how to re-check.
