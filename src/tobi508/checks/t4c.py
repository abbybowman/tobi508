"""Test 4.C (2.1.2-no-keyboard-trap), from specs/rules/4c-no-keyboard-trap.md.

collect() gathers evidence (passes P1-P4 and P6) into a State4C; evaluate()
applies the spec's tables to it. Only evaluate() and the row tables decide
outcomes, and every row matches a row in the spec. J1/J2 answers are facts
(keys, values); pressing J1's keys (M6/M7) needs the browser, so that evidence
is gathered by probe_answers() once an answer arrives. J2's values are never
typed into the page: a person tries them (M8).
