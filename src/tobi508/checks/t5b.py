"""Test 5.B (2.4.6-label-descriptive), from specs/rules/5b-label-descriptive.md.

Evidence is pass L (`labels.labels_pass`, shared with 5.A and 5.C): each
field's visible label, the text near it and its image; each button's visible
text. One J1 per form asks whether the labels describe their fields and
buttons. Only evaluate() and the row tables decide outcomes.
