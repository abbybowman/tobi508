"""Test 5.D (3.2.2-on-input), from specs/rules/5d-on-input.md.

Fields come from the shared walk's P1 stops (`stop.control`). Fill pass F
replays to the first field and completes every field in order, observing
the completion and the Tab that leaves it (the shared `observe`, with form
submissions). A mechanical change of context restarts the pass on a fresh
replay with the earlier fields refilled. Only evaluate() and the row tables
decide outcomes.
