"""Judgment backends for questions a rule cannot decide on its own.

The rules spec creates OpenQuestions ("open questions" to users). A Judge
answers them now or defers them:

  ClientJudge  defers every question to the calling agent. Questions go out in
               tool output with a rubric and evidence file paths; answers come
               back through the tobi_answer_questions tool. Used because Claude Code
               does not support MCP sampling.
  ApiJudge     the server's own judge (apijudge.py): it answers the question
               types switched on in JUDGE_TYPES after a run's report is
               written; here it defers every question, and the loop in
               apijudge.judge_run takes the ones it may answer.

Answers are recorded as-is. Turning answers into finding outcomes is the rules
spec's job, so nothing here changes a Finding.
