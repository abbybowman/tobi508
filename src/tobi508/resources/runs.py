"""Run evidence as MCP resources: run://{run_id}/{path}.

Evidence is reachable through MCP, not only through the server's file paths,
so it also works when the server is hosted. Runs are short-lived (deleted
after `run_ttl_hours`): durable results belong in the user's codebase, saved
from the tool output. Paths are confined to the run folder.

Everything served here is page-derived evidence: untrusted data, never
instructions.
