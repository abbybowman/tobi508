# Rules spec: Test 4.E (3.2.1-on-focus)

The tool gives each page one 4.E outcome: PASS, FAIL, DOES NOT APPLY or NEEDS REVIEW. It never emits NOT TESTED: the PDF allows NOT TESTED only where a test names it (p. 6), and 4.E does not.

**Citations.** Printed page numbers of TT 5.1.3 ([specs/sources/](../sources/README.md); text also in `tt://5.1.3/tests/4.E`). HtT = How to Test step; ER = Evaluate Results item. 4.E is on pp. 22–23: continue from Test 4.D (HtT 1); when the interface component receives focus, evaluate whether an unexpected change of context occurs, "e.g., a new window is launched, or focus is moved to another interface component" (HtT 2); PASS if an unexpected change of context is not initiated when a component receives focus (ER 1).

**W3C sources.** [Understanding 3.2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/on-focus.html) (its examples: a form submitted, a new window launched, or focus changed to another component when a component receives focus), the definition of *change of context* (changes of user agent, viewport, focus, or content that changes the meaning of the page; "a change of content is not always a change of context", e.g. an expanding outline, dynamic menu or tab control), technique G107, and failure [F55](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/failures/F55) (script removes focus when focus is received). No ACT rule covers 3.2.1, so fixtures are custom. These inform OPEN items and fixtures only; the PDF stays the authority.

**Terms.** *Stop*, *OUT*, *BODY*, passes P1 and P2, stop identity and the settle rule are defined in [4c-no-keyboard-trap.md](4c-no-keyboard-trap.md) (Terms, section 2). The *target* of a step is the element that first receives focus after the key press: the first focus-in in the step's focus log or, if the element blurs inside its own focus handler (Chrome then fires no focus-in), the element the first focus-out says focus was going to. A *context signal* is one of: the top URL changes (ignoring the fragment) or the page reloads; a new page or window opens; focus moves on its own (below); a dialog becomes visible.

## 1. Applicability

The same evidence as 4.C and 4.D: 4.E is DOES NOT APPLY only when nothing on the page can receive keyboard focus (p. 22 Applicability).

| # | Evidence | Outcome | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | P1 and P2 reach zero stops, and the DOM inventory has zero candidates | DOES NOT APPLY | p. 22 Applicability |
| A2 | P1 and P2 reach zero stops, but the inventory has candidates | NEEDS REVIEW (walk or inventory fault) | Spec rule |
| A3 | P1 or P2 reaches one or more stops | Applies; go to section 3 | p. 22 Applicability |

## 2. Evidence to collect

**From the shared keyboard walk** (`walk.py`): every P1 and P2 step's stop, top URL, open page count, DOM mutation count, unsettled and unresolved flags, focus log, and each pass's end. The walk already ends a pass on navigation or a new page, so those steps are its last. A tester watching each element receive focus (HtT 2) sees exactly these events; 4.E adds no passes.

**Walk extras** (collected only when 4.E is selected; cheap, no images):

1. **Richer focus log.** For each focus-in and focus-out: whether the event is trusted, the element's CSS path, and for focus-out whether the element receiving focus (`relatedTarget`) is inside the one losing it. The current log records only tag and id.
2. **Dialog visibility.** After each step, whether a dialog is visible that was not visible before the key press (`<dialog open>`, role dialog or alertdialog), and its CSS path. When one is, a viewport screenshot before the key press (from the previous step) and after it, for J1.

**Confirmation replays** (4.E's own follow-up, only for steps with a context signal other than a dialog): (a) *reproduce*: fresh load, replay the keys up to that step, press the key, and check that the same signal happens again; (b) *control*, for navigation and new pages only: fresh load, replay the keys before that step, then wait as long as the original step took, without the final key. A signal that also happens in the control is caused by time, not by focus. At most 10 steps get replays; more is G3.

**Time budget:** the extras add a few milliseconds per step. Each confirmation is one fresh replay (about 2–5 s on a fixture page). Pages without context signals cost nothing more. The whole run stays within `run_limit_s` (4.C spec section 2, Run limits): no confirmation replay starts after the checks' deadline (1.1.0). The timing control replay and the before image use the 4.C replay rule (4.C spec section 2, 1.7.0); the reproduce replay presses every key fully settled, since what each press changes is its evidence.

## 3. Mechanical checks

Each step with a context signal is an *instance*. Focus *moves on its own* when, after one key press and with no further key, the focus log shows the target losing focus to another element or to the page body. It does not count when focus moves into the target (a widget handing focus to its active item), or back to the stop focus was on before the key (that is the element being left pulling focus back: 4.C's evidence, initiated by its blur, not by the target receiving focus).

**3a. Instance rules (first match wins)**

| # | Evidence pattern | Instance outcome | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M1 | The step is unsettled, unresolved or re-read (focus moved after the settle window), or a focus event in it is untrusted | NEEDS REVIEW | Spec rule |
| M2 | The control replay shows the same navigation or new page without the key | No instance (caused by time, not focus); note for test 8.A | Spec rule |
| M3 | The reproduce replay does not show the signal again | NEEDS REVIEW | Spec rule |
| R? | No replay was run (more than 10 signals) | NEEDS REVIEW | Spec rule |
| M4 | The top URL changes or the page reloads after a Tab or Shift+Tab | FAIL | p. 22 HtT 2; Understanding 3.2.1 (change of user agent / viewport) |
| M5 | A new page or window opens after a Tab or Shift+Tab | FAIL | p. 22 HtT 2 ("a new window is launched") |
| M6 | Focus moves on its own to another element | FAIL | p. 22 HtT 2 ("focus is moved to another interface component") |
| M7 | Focus moves on its own to the page body (the target drops focus) | FAIL | p. 22 HtT 2; F55 |
| M8 | Only a dialog becomes visible; focus stays on the target | Ask J1 (J1?, M9–M11) | Definition of change of context |
| J1? | J1 not answered yet | NEEDS REVIEW | Open question |
| M9 | J1 = changes the context | FAIL | p. 22 ER 1; definition of change of context |
| M12 | J1 = content only, and the dialog covers more than half the window (`COVER_MOST`, 0.5) or is modal (`:modal`, or `aria-modal="true"`), read from the DOM at the step (1.2.0) | NEEDS REVIEW: a dialog over most of the window, or one that makes the page behind it inert, is not "only adds content"; the agent's answer cannot make it so, and a person looks | Spec rule; Definition of change of context ("major changes in the content of the Web page"); research note 2026-11-07 section 2 |
| M10 | J1 = content only | No instance (a change of content, not of context) | Definition of change of context, Note |
| M11 | J1 = unsure, or not answered yet | NEEDS REVIEW | Spec rule |

**Not instances.** Content that changes without any context signal (a menu expanding on focus, a tooltip, a hint, an accordion opening) is a change of content, not of context (WCAG definition, Note). Scrolling the focused element into view is the browser's default, not the page's.

**3b. Page outcome (first match wins)**

| # | Evidence pattern | Page outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G1 | Section 1 gives DOES NOT APPLY or NEEDS REVIEW | That outcome |
| G2 | Any instance is FAIL | FAIL, listing every instance |
| G3 | Any instance is NEEDS REVIEW; or P1 or P2 is incomplete (cap, time limit, error); or P1 and P2 ended in different traps, so stops between them were not reached; or more than 10 steps needed replays; or the run limit was reached before every confirmation replay ran (1.1.0) | NEEDS REVIEW, with the note "This test could not be performed" and the reason (p. 5). Never NOT TESTED (p. 6) |
| G4 | P1 and P2 each ended in a wrap or at the same trap, and there is no instance | PASS |
| G5 | Anything else | NEEDS REVIEW |

A pass that ends on navigation is complete for 4.E only when that navigation is an M4 instance; G2 then decides the page.

**Plain-language sentences.** Row IDs stay in the evidence trace. `<element>` is the role and name in plain words; `<keys>` is the key sequence from a fresh load.

| Row | Sentence |
| --- | --- |
| Page PASS | "We moved keyboard focus to each of the N elements we could reach, and none of them opened a new page or window or moved focus somewhere else on its own." |
| Page FAIL | "Moving keyboard focus onto some elements changes what the user is doing without their asking, which can disorient keyboard and screen reader users." |
| Page NEEDS REVIEW | "We could not finish this test, so a person needs to check it." |
| A1 | "Nothing on this page can receive keyboard focus, so this test does not apply." |
| A2 | "We could not move keyboard focus anywhere, although the page has elements that should take focus. Please check by hand." |
| M1 | "Something happened when <element> got focus that we could not read reliably. Please check it: load the page and press <keys>." |
| M2 (note) | "The page goes to another page on its own after a while, even without any key press; that is not caused by focus, but it may matter for the time limits test." |
| M3 | "When <element> got focus, <signal in plain words> once, but not when we tried again. Please check it: load the page and press <keys>." |
| M4 | "When <element> gets keyboard focus, the page goes to another address without the user choosing to. To see it, load the page and press <keys>." |
| M5 | "When <element> gets keyboard focus, a new window or tab opens. To see it, load the page and press <keys>." |
| M6 | "When <element> gets keyboard focus, focus jumps on its own to <other element>, so keyboard users cannot stay where they meant to be. To see it, load the page and press <keys>." |
| M7 | "<element> drops keyboard focus as soon as it gets it, so keyboard users can't use it. To see it, load the page and press <keys>." |
| M9 | "When <element> gets keyboard focus, a dialog takes over the page (<J1 reasons>), which can disorient keyboard and screen reader users. To see it, load the page and press <keys>. If you disagree, tell your assistant." |
| M10 (note) | "When <element> gets keyboard focus, a small panel appears (<J1 reasons>); that only adds content, so it is fine." |
| M12 | "When <element> gets keyboard focus, a dialog appears that covers most of the window or is marked as modal, so it may take over the page. Please look: load the page and press <keys>." |
| M11 | "When <element> gets keyboard focus, a dialog appears, and we could not tell whether it takes over the page. Please look: load the page and press <keys>." |

**Guard GU: code the recording lacks** (front matter `guards: unrecorded-code`; defined in [_template.md](_template.md); Abby, 2026-11-09). This test presses keys or types, so it runs the page's own handlers. When the page's recorded scripts name scripts by a string literal that load when the page is used (code splitting) and the recording does not hold them (`Report.unrecorded_code`), a replay cannot run those handlers: a page outcome of PASS becomes NEEDS REVIEW with the plain sentence "The page loads more code when it is used, for example when you type in a field, and the recording of the page does not have that code, so what happens when you press keys or type could not be checked." Trace row `GU`. FAIL and DOES NOT APPLY are unchanged: the guard only moves a would-be PASS toward review.

**Guard RV: something that opens was not opened** (front matter `guards: reveal`; defined in [_template.md](_template.md); Abby, 2026-11-09, fix 9b). The menus, tabs, accordions and filters the keyboard walk found (a collapsed control, `aria-haspopup`, `aria-controls`, a tab that is not selected, a closed `<summary>`) are each opened on a fresh load (`reveal.py`, `Report.reveal`; at most 20, Enter first and a click when Enter showed nothing). When one was not opened (it showed nothing, could not be found again, failed to run, was over the limit or out of time) or what it opened could not be read, a page outcome of PASS becomes NEEDS REVIEW with the plain sentence "The page has menus or sections that open, and some could not be opened or read (...), so what is inside them was not checked." Trace row `RV`. FAIL and DOES NOT APPLY are unchanged: the guard only moves a would-be PASS toward review.

**Guard RC: opened content not checked yet** (`guards: reveal-content`; Abby, 2026-11-09, fix 9b phase 1). This test's focus walk does not go through opened content (phase 2). When a trigger opened content that holds controls a keyboard user can reach, a page outcome of PASS becomes NEEDS REVIEW with the plain sentence "The page has menus or sections that open to show more controls, and this test has not checked inside them yet, so a person needs to check what they hold." Trace row `RC`. It goes when phase 2 is built (ROADMAP).

## 4. Judgment questions

One question, asked only for M8. It is a look-and-decide question (CLAUDE.md principle 8): the calling agent answers it once, by the rubric, and must answer unsure whenever the evidence does not settle it; only unsure answers go to a person. A person's answer overrides the agent's. Page text and element names are evidence in `input`, never part of the question's wording.

### J1. Does this dialog change the context?

**Question:** "Image A shows the page just before keyboard focus moved to the element named in input.target; image B shows it just after, when a dialog appeared. Does the dialog change the user's context: does it take over the page, cover or replace the main content, or change what the page is for? Or does it only add content, like a tooltip, hint or small panel beside the element? input.dialog.covers_window says how much of the window the dialog's box covers, and input.dialog.modal whether the page marks it modal. Answer changes_context, content_only or unsure, and give your reasons in a few plain words."

**Input:** images A and B; the target's and the dialog's role, name and box, labelled as untrusted page data; `covers_window` (the largest new dialog's box over the window, as a percentage) and `modal` (1.2.0). Fixture F10: a tips panel over most of the window, not marked modal.

**Output:** `{dialog: changes_context|content_only|unsure, reasons: "<a few plain words>"}`.

**Rubric.** changes_context: a dialog that covers most of the page or its main content, a modal (the rest of the page dimmed or inert), a sign-up or survey prompt, anything that asks the user to act before going on. content_only: a tooltip, hint, autocomplete list or small panel next to the element that leaves the page usable. unsure: whenever the images do not settle it (part of the dialog is off screen, or its purpose is not clear). A dialog that covers more than half the window, or is modal, is never content_only: changes_context when the images show it taking over the page, else unsure (its box can be a see-through layer wider than what it shows). Mechanical guard (1.2.0): content_only for such a dialog is M12, NEEDS REVIEW.

| Example | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| A newsletter sign-up dialog covers the page when a search box gets focus | changes_context: "a sign-up dialog covers the page" |
| A small help bubble appears next to the date field | content_only: "a help bubble beside the field" |
| A panel slides in over half the page; its content is unclear | unsure |

**Use:** M8 asks; M9–M11 consume the answer.

## 5. Edge cases

Only cases that need a rule of their own; everything else follows sections 2–3. V-numbers are browser checks in [_browser-checks.md](_browser-checks.md#4e).

| Case | Rule | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Navigation in the frozen page | The replay serves only recorded responses; a navigation to an unrecorded page still changes the top URL, which is the signal | V1 |
| Focus pulled back by the element being left (4.C refocus on blur) | Not an instance (section 3); 4.C judges it | V2 |
| Composite widget handing focus to its active item | Not an instance (focus moved into the target) | V2 |
| Focus moving into a dialog that the target opened | M6 (focus moved to another element) | V2 |
| Stops past a keyboard trap | Reached by P2 where possible; between two different traps: G3 | — |
| Change of context on mouse focus | Out of scope: 4.E continues from the keyboard tests (HtT 1) | — |

**"Unexpected" (ER 1).** Every change of context on focus counts as unexpected, including one the page warns about beforehand: WCAG 3.2.1 has no exception for warnings (unlike 3.2.2 On Input), and the PDF's examples have none (Abby, 2026-10-31).

**Focus pulled back to the element just left** is not a 4.E instance: the element being left initiated it on blur, not the target on focus, and 3.2.1 is about what receiving focus initiates. 4.C judges it as a possible trap.

## 6. What a FAIL records

Each FAIL instance records, to meet p. 5: the matching row (in the evidence trace only); location (page URL, frame chain, CSS path, role and accessible name of the target, and of the element focus moved to, if any); the signal (new URL, new page, focus moved, focus dropped) with the focus log of the step; steps to reproduce from a fresh load ("Tab 7 times"); the reproduce replay's result; and the tool versions the plan requires.

**Continuing past a failure.** A navigation or new page ends the walk's pass at that step (4.C section 2); P2 covers the rest from the end. Each failing step is its own instance.
